# Thesis Code Challenge

The goal of this project is to recreate a mock website. The comp was provided and strictly uses HTML and CSS.

## Successes

The mock is very close to the comp. The colors are correct and close attention was paid to the details such as capitalization and positioning.

## Challenges

Libraries and frameworks were not allowed so finding the correct social media icons was a challenge. The shadows on the buttons are off as well. 

## My Favorite Part

I really enjoyed learning how to use linear gradient to create the background.
