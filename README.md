#Thesis Code Challenge

The goal of this project is to recreate a mock website. The comp was provided as strictly uses HTML and CSS.

##Successes

The mock is very close to the comp. The color are correct and close attention was paid to same details such as capitalization and positioning.

##Challenges

Libraries and frameworks were not allowed so finding the correct social media icons was a challenge. The shadowing on the buttons is off as well. 

##My Favorite Part

I really enjoyed working on this project and learnign how to use linear gradient to create the background.
